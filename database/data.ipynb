Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \\nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offen ce, \\nthough he may run down the boat C by d oing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \\nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order t o prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property.

Act done in good faith for benef it of a person without consent .—Nothing is an offence by \\nreason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without \\nthat person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, \\nor if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of \\nhim from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\nProvisos.

Act to which a p erson is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by \\nthreats, which, at the time of doing it, reason ably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person \\nwill otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reas on of a threat of being beaten, joins a \\ngang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of \\nhis having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n95.

Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is risk of harm to innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without \\nrisk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\nIllustration \\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if \\nby so firing he harms any of the children. \\nCHAPTER V \\nOF ABETMENT \\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or b y wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\nIllustration \\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by ins tigation the \\napprehension of C. \\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is sai d to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, wh o abets either the commission of an offence, or the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of  the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although \\nthe abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should \\nbe committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of \\ninstigating B to commit murder. \\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any  guilty \\nintention or knowledge. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content=\"31 \\n \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a \\nperson capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or \\nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling -house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling -house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committ ed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \\ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \\nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, d oes not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of \\nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \\nalso an offence. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in \\nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; an d, as A instigated B \\nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. I t is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\nIllustration \\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C \\nmentioning that a third pe rson is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n1[108A. Abetment in India of of fences outside India .—A person abets an offence within the  \\nmeaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] \\nwhich would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. \\nIllustration \\nA, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no \\nexpress provision is made for its punishment .—Whoever abets any offence shall, if t he act abetted is \\ncommitted in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the \\npunishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\nExplanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is \\ncommitted in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some  favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B \\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and  the Sch., \\nto read as above. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=\"32 \\n \\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the pois on to Z in A ‟s absence and thereby causes Z ‟s \\ndeath. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention  from that of \\nabettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for \\nthe offence which would have been com mitted if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge \\nof the abettor and with no other. \\n111. Liability of abettor when one act a betted and different act done .—When an Act is abetted \\nand a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent \\nas if he had directly abetted it: \\nProvided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \\nabetment. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the \\nside of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was \\nunder the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to \\nthe same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z ‟s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being  resisted by Z, one of \\nthe inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for murder. \\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for  act abetted and for act done .—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to resist by force  a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence , resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of \\nresisting the distress, and the off ence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, \\nif A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punis hment for each \\nof the offences. \\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in cons equence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed .—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='33 \\n \\n115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life .—if offence not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the comm ission of an off ence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for \\nlife], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment  of either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\nif act causin g harm be done in consequence .—and if any act for which the abettor is liable in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any per son, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the \\npunishment of death or 1[imprisonment for life]. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven \\nyears and also to a fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be lia ble to imprisonment for a term \\nwhich may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. \\n116.

A some  favour in the exercise of B ‟s official functions. \\nB refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police -officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offe nce.

Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of \\nlaw to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement \\nwhich is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to \\ngive false evidence. \\nExplanation 1.—A statement is wit hin the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or \\notherwise. \\nExplanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this \\nsection, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he \\ndoes not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z \\nadmit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. \\n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when \\nhe does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false \\nevidence. \\n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of \\nZ; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely a s to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, \\nalthough the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. \\n(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on  a particular day, not \\nknowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. \\n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translat ion of a statement or document  which \\nhe is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretat ion or \\ntranslation.

A has fabricated false evidence. \\n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop -book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A  has \\nfabricated false evidence. \\n(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, \\npurporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that t he \\nofficers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n193.

Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, \\nor with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that \\nhe is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \\nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed th e offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending  to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and ste al it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. \\nHere, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B , or to cause \\ndeath by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \\nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, \\ndisease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused \\nhis death. \\n                                                           \\n1.

Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content=\"73 \\n \\nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused  by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury \\nshall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment \\nthe death might have been prevented. \\nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n300. Murder.—Except in the cas es hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury \\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without \\nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intent ion \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \\nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound sta te of \\nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause de ath, or such \\nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword -cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1 .—When c ulpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self -control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for \\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise o f the right of \\nprivate defence. \\nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally k ills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune i n \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content=\"74 \\n \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on t his provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder , but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A i s excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he d oes not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prev ent him from doing \\nso. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was \\ngiving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation e xcited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \\nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only  \\nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \\nright of private defence o f person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such r ight of defence without premeditation, and \\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z pers ists in the \\nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \\nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, bein g a public servant or aiding a \\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \\ndischarge of his d uty as such public servant and without ill -will towards the person whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the o ffender's having taken undue \\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocatio n or commits the first \\nassault. \\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose de ath is caused, being above \\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration \\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a pers on under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \\nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than pe rson whose death was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to ca use death, \\ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows \\nhimself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of \\nwhich it would have been if he had cau sed the death of the person whose death he intended or knew  \\nhimself to he likely to cause. \\n302. Punishment for murder .—Whoever commits murder sha ll be punished with death or \\n1[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine. \\n303. Punishment for mu rder by life -convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of 1[imprisonment \\nfor life], commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n                                                           \\n1.

A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is  \\nproduced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of forc e will \\ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses , and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A h as therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes th e pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring \\nit into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so withou t Z's consent, intending or \\nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or wit h Z's \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, h e has used criminal \\nforce to Z. \\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does  so without her consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own b odily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such c ontact \\nmust affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without  Z's consent \\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he  uses \\ncriminal force to Z. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\ipc (1).pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='83 \\n \\n351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that \\ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amou nt to an \\nassault. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to stri ke \\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intendin g or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherw ise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by \\nthat person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to \\nthree months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the \\noffence, or \\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n353.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the poss ession of \\nany person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commi t \\ntheft. \\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle wh ich prevented \\nit from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\nExplanation 5 .—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be \\ngiven either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express \\nor implied. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's \\nconsent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \\ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box o f treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \\ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's pla te, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \\nconsent. A has committed theft. \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \\ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was no t in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \\nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is i n Z's possession, and if A \\ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \\nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \\nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \\nring, commits theft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any d ebt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's  hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in asmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \\nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the propert y as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \\ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n                                                           \\n1.

Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \\nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \\nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husban d. Here it \\nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authori sed to give away alms. If this was A's impress ion, A has not committed \\ntheft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and  to be such \\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \\nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n379.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and m akes the sum \\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intent ion of \\nselling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill u p the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n(f) Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\nout B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement.

A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, inte nding it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it  to \\nZ. A has committed forgery. \\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the \\nwill according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will.

Here, as A made a false \\ndocument in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter i nto an express o r \\nimplied contract for service. \\nExplanation 1.—A man‟s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same \\nname.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease \\nof the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause \\nit to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors ; and in order to \\ngive a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himsel f to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending \\nthat it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency.
